            // concepts
            //
            // suppose we want to create multiple cars
            // we can certainly create multiple object instance by:
            const toyota = {
                name: "corolla",
                brand: "toyota",
                drive: function () {
                    console.log("brum brum");
                },
            };

            const honda = {
                name: "civic",
                brand: "honda",
                drive: function () {
                    console.log("brum brum");
                },
            };

            // but this can become quite tedious after a while
            // would be great if we can define a template that create these car objects

            // In OOP, an object template is called 'Class'

            // Another analogy:
            // If you are playing an online game
            // You'd get to choose multiple character class to play from, eg Warrior, Mage, Knight, Ranger etc
            // These character classes are sort of like a template right?
            // In OOP this is known as Class

            // Once you've chosen a class you would give your character a name.
            // At this point, you've created a game character and this character is unique.
            // In OOP this is known as an object instance.

            // In summary
            // Character === Object
            // Character Class === Class
            // We create (aka instantiate) an object out from a class.
            // just like how we create a powerpoint slide out from a template

            // as a convention we capitalise the class name
            class Car {

                // property
                name = 'a car';

                // constructor is a function that runs everytime an object is created from this class
                constructor(name, brand) {
                    console.log("creating a new brum");
                    this.name = name;
                    this.brand = brand;
                }

                drive = function() {
                    console.log("brum brum");
                }
            }

            // we use the 'new' keyword to instantiate a new Object from a class
            const newCar = new Car("swift", "toyota");
            newCar.drive();

            // class syntax is only available after ES6 (ES6 is a JS version name released at 2015)

            // Prior to ES6 we create a so called 'constructor' function:
            function Car(name, brand) {
                this.name = name;
                this.brand = brand;
                this.drive = function () {};
            }

            // to add new method
            Car.prototype.start = function () {
                console.log("brummm");
            };
